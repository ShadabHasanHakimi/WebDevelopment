In express, middlewares are functions that come into play after the server receives the request and before the response is sent to the client.

- Middlewares already used:
1. methodOverride: for using req like DELETE, etc
2. bodyParser: for parsing data in the body of the req
3. express.static: for serving static files like css to frontend
4. express.urlencoded: for accessing data in req

What do middlewares do?
-Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
1. Execute any code
2. Make changes to the request and the response objects
3. End the request-response cycle
4. Call the next middleware function in the stack
