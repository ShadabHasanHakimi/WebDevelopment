Group by clause: Group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
It collects data from multiple records and gropus the result by one or more column.

SELECT col1, col2
FROM table_name
GROUP BY col_name(s);

For eg:
SELECT count(id)
FROM user
GROUP BY age;

-Above eg will give us the group of users according to their age.

*Generally we use group by with some aggregation function.


-Having Clause: Similar to Where i.e. applies some condition on rows.
But it is used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.

SELECT col1, col2
FROM table_name
GROUP BY col_name(s)
HAVING condition;

-WHERE  is for table, HAVING is for a group
-Grouping is necessary for HAVING

For eg: 
SELECT age, followers
FROM table_name
GROUP BY age
HAVING condition;
