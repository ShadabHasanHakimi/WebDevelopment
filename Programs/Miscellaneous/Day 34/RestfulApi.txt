RESTful API's are used in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

These are a set of rules which define how to use API's. Follow the link for the rules : https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/

CRUD operations:
1. GET retrieves resources
2. POST submits new data to the server
3. PUT updated existing data
4. PATCH update existing data partially
5. DELETE removes data

Creating RESTful API's:
GET - /posts - to get data for all posts - INDEX(main)
POST - /posts - to add a new post - CREATE 
GET - /posts/:id - to get one post(using id) - VIEW
PATCH - /posts/:id - to update specific post - UPDATE 
DELETE - /posts/:id - to delete specific post - DESTROY
