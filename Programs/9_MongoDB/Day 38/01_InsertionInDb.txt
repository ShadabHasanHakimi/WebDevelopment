- We can insert data in db using JSON format
- inserting single document
db.student.insertOne({name: "shadab", age: 20, marks: 84})

- We can insert another document with different attributes also, unlike sql
db.student.insertOne({name: "vikalp", age: 21, marks: 84, city: "kota"})

- MongoDB generates id for every document inserted which acts as primary key for that document

- inserting multiple documents at a time
db.student.insertMany([{name: "vikalp", age: 21, marks: 84, city: "kota"}, {name: "shadab", age: 20, marks: 84}])

- db.student.find() is used to print all the documents and ctrl+l is used to clear screen in mongosh.

- For finding or reading specific document, we can use:
db.collection.find({key: value})
For eg: db.student.find({age: 20})
It returns cursor(reference), which helps in looping through the data.

- For finding or reading specific document, but only one document, we can use:
db.collection.findOne({key: value})
For eg: db.student.findOne({age: 20})
It returns actual document
